            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, we&#x27;re celebrating <em>höstlov</em> with a small new Ghostly release!</p><p>This is just a maintenance release that bumps Ghostly&#x27;s dependencies. In particular, Playwright has been upgraded from
1.12 to 1.16, which allows it to run correctly on <em>macOS 12</em>.</p><p>Playwright 1.13 and later had a problem with <code>file:</code> URLs, which is why we have stuck with 1.12 for a while now. But
that problem has finally been addressed in this Ghostly release.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, I&#x27;m glad to let you know that Ghostly version 2.1 has been released.</p><p>Besides some internal chores—like switching from <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com">Yarn</a> to <a href="https://pnpm.io/">pnpm</a>—this version adds an <code>inline</code> transform to the
<a href="/ghostly/docs/api/interfaces/ghostly_engine.View#htmltransforms">html-transforms</a> pipeline (which is now implemented as a <a href="https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype">rehype</a> pipeline). The inliner is capable of inlining CSS,
JavaScript and any kind of URL by converting the linked resource to a <code>data:</code> URL. Any inlined resource will be
processed by the pipeline before it&#x27;s included into the main document.</p><p>Additonally, the default <code>sanitizer</code> transform (using <a href="https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify">DOMPurify</a>), while still available, has been replaced with a much
less intrusive <code>noscript</code> transform by default, and <code>minimize</code> is now based on <a href="https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-minify">rehype-minify</a> instead of
<a href="https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier">html-minifier</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#x27;m happy to announce that Ghostly v2 is now released! Version 2.0 is an <strong><em>substantial</em></strong> upgrade over last release.</p><p>Both the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@divine/ghostly-engine">engine</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@divine/ghostly-runtime">runtime</a> modules (now part of the <em>Divine</em> family of open source software) ships with full
<em>TypeScript</em> definitions, and Ghostly is now powered by a modern browser (<em>Chromium</em> by default, but you can opt in to
use <em>Firefox</em> or <em>WebKit</em> instead), thanks to <a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a>.</p><p>The third major improvement comes in the form of <em>attachments</em> support. A template may now announce that it can produce
any number of secondary results as part of the model initialization. For instance, a sales report template could attach
the sales data as a CSV attachment, ready to be imported into a spreadsheet application for further analysis.</p>]]></content:encoded>
