Another month, another minor Ghostly release; Version 2.3 is now available!

New in this release is that

* Events are now delivered in real-time, instead of all at once when the rendering has completed; and that
* Some configuration options, notably [logger] & [timeout], may now be changed [per-template]. This is awesome if, for
  instance, you have a [per-request logger] in your web-service, because now all Ghostly logs originating from this
  request can be tagged with a unique reqest ID.

[logger]:              /ghostly/docs/api/interfaces/ghostly_engine.TemplateConfig#logger
[timeout]:             /ghostly/docs/api/interfaces/ghostly_engine.TemplateConfig#timeout
[per-template]:        /ghostly/docs/api/classes/ghostly_engine.Engine#template
[per-request logger]:  https://divine-software.github.io/esxx-2/web-service/classes/webrequest.html#log
