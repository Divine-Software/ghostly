Today, we're celebrating *h√∂stlov* with a small new Ghostly release!

This is just a maintenance release that bumps Ghostly's dependencies. In particular, Playwright has been upgraded from
1.12 to 1.16, which allows it to run correctly on *macOS 12*.

Playwright 1.13 and later had a problem with `file:` URLs, which is why we have stuck with 1.12 for a while now. But
that problem has finally been addressed in this Ghostly release.
