Today, I'm glad to let you know that Ghostly version 2.1 has been released.

Besides some internal chores—like switching from [Yarn] to [pnpm]—this version adds an `inline` transform to the
[html-transforms] pipeline (which is now implemented as a [rehype] pipeline). The inliner is capable of inlining CSS,
JavaScript and any kind of URL by converting the linked resource to a `data:` URL. Any inlined resource will be
processed by the pipeline before it's included into the main document.

Additonally, the default `sanitizer` transform (using [DOMPurify]), while still available, has been replaced with a much
less intrusive `noscript` transform by default, and `minimize` is now based on [rehype-minify] instead of
[html-minifier].
