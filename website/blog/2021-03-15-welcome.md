I'm happy to announce that Ghostly v2 is now released! Version 2.0 is an ***substantial*** upgrade over last release.

Both the [engine] and [runtime] modules (now part of the *Divine* family of open source software) ships with full
*TypeScript* definitions, and Ghostly is now powered by a modern browser (*Chromium* by default, but you can opt in to
use *Firefox* or *WebKit* instead), thanks to [Playwright].

The third major improvement comes in the form of *attachments* support. A template may now announce that it can produce
any number of secondary results as part of the model initialization. For instance, a sales report template could attach
the sales data as a CSV attachment, ready to be imported into a spreadsheet application for further analysis.
